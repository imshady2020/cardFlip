                Card Flip pulls data from recently sold eBay listings and averages them together to give
                you a good estimate of what your sports cards are valued at. This is the first iteration
                of Card Flip, we are hoping to bring you more features in the future including:

                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating a collection or portfolio to track overall value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating alerts to be notified if certain price levels are reached.
